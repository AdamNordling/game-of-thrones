		<h2>A Song of Ice And Fire</h2>
		Game of Thrones <h2 id="rubrik2"></h2>is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. 
		<br/><br/>

		Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plots and a large ensemble cast, but follows three story arcs. The first arc is about the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the noble dynasties either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from it. The second story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled and is plotting a return to the throne. The third story arc follows the Night's Watch, a brotherhood defending the realm against the fierce peoples and legendary creatures of the North.

	<p>Ser Jaime  Lannister, also known as the Kingslayer, is a knight from House Lannister. He is the second child and first-born son of Lord Tywin Lannister of Casterly Rock and his wife, Lady Joanna, also of House Lannister. He is the twin brother of Queen Cersei Lannister.

	Raised at the age of fifteen to the Kingsguard of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, Jaime became the youngest member in the history of the prestigious knightly order. He earned the derogatory nickname "Kingslayer" when he treasonously slew Aerys near the end of Robert's Rebellion. In A Storm of Swords, Jaime becomes a POV character. In the television adaptation Game of Thrones he <a href="#rubrik2">rubrik2</a>is played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.</p>
